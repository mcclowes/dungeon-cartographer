# Parchment Style Improvements

Potential enhancements for the parchment/treasure map render style.

## Visual Style

- [ ] **Organic/wobbly borders** - More irregular, hand-drawn edges that meander slightly instead of smooth curves
- [ ] **Grid lines across full parchment** - Faint grid extends across margins/wall areas, not just inside rooms
- [ ] **Varied hatching patterns** - Crosshatch with varied angles, not just perpendicular strokes
- [ ] **Edge wear/torn edges** - Rough, torn-looking edges around the parchment border
- [ ] **Fold lines/creases** - Subtle fold marks across the parchment surface

## Map Decorations

- [ ] **Room labels/numbers** - Option to add room identifiers (I, II, III, etc.)
- [ ] **Compass rose** - Classic N/S/E/W decoration
- [ ] **Scale bar** - "10 feet" style indicator
- [ ] **Legend** - Key explaining tile symbols
- [ ] **Title cartouche** - Decorative frame for map title

## Tile Rendering

- [ ] **Secret doors** - Different visual treatment (dotted line with 'S')
- [ ] **Pillars/columns** - Support columns in large rooms
- [ ] **Furniture** - Tables, beds, altars for room dressing
- [ ] **Rubble/debris** - Collapsed areas

## Generation Quality

- [ ] **Reduce trap clustering** - Better spacing between trap placements
- [ ] **Even feature distribution** - Spread features across rooms, not clustered
- [ ] **Room-aware placement** - Place features considering room size/purpose
- [ ] **Minimum distances** - Enforce spacing between special tiles
